# IoT-Based Automated Water Level Monitoring and Controlling System

This project monitors and controls water levels in tanks using ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino microcontroller. It prevents overflow and dry motor running using automated logic and real-time monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- Relay Module
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Tinkercad Simulation

## Features
- Real-time tank and sump level monitoring
- Automated motor control based on water levels
- Overflow and dry-run protection
- Energy-efficient and low-cost design
